--------------------------

any Video to ASCII tool made by @justhighlol

you can use it however you like and ist completely open source. 

IF YOU SHOULD POST ANYTHING MADE WTIH THIS MENTION MY NAME IN THE VIDEO OR THE DESCRIPTION!!!
I dont take any responsibility for what you do with this!


--------------------------

You must have python, pip and ffmpeg installed for this to work. If you dont know how to install it then Google it. 
For ffmpeg i recommend installing the ffmpeg-master into the same Directory as the python file. (ffmpeg-master must be in ist own Folder)



use this command to install all dependencies (must be runned in the Directory where the requirements.txt file is located)

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt


--------------------------

To use this tool you have to put a Video file (mp4) into the same Folder as ASCIIplayer.py and then run the script.

Here is an example command on how to use it:

python ASCIIplayer.py input.mp4 -o output.mp4 -w 140 -H 80 -fs 18
